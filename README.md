Monkeypox Detection using MobileNet & TensorFlow
Overview
This project implements a Monkeypox Detection model using MobileNet as a feature extractor and a custom classification head. The model is trained on a dataset of Monkeypox images and uses transfer learning to classify infected vs. non-infected cases.

Project Structure
Dataset: Images are organized into Train, Validation, and Test directories.
Preprocessing: Image augmentation and normalization using ImageDataGenerator.
Model: MobileNet-based CNN with additional dense layers.
Training: Optimized with Adam optimizer and monitored using a learning rate scheduler.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are computed.
Requirements
Install the required dependencies before running the code:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
Dataset Structure
Ensure your dataset follows this directory structure:

mpox/
â”‚â”€â”€ Fold1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Train/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Infected/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Non-Infected/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Val/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Infected/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Non-Infected/

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Infected/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Non-Infected/
Each folder should contain images of Monkeypox-infected and non-infected cases.

How to Run
1. Train the Model
Run the script to start training:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
The model will be trained for 4 epochs with binary cross-entropy loss.
Learning rate reduces automatically if validation loss stagnates.
2. Evaluate the Model
After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, computing:

Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
Class-wise Accuracy
Key Features
